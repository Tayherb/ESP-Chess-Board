# ESP-Chess-Board
DIY chessboard with a built in ESP32 chip to co-ordinate gameplay through a server
This project is the design and construction of the physical board.
For board programming see https://github.com/scottyob/esp-chess

Design file formats

DXF and STP files are available for CNC programming. (laser, etc)
DXF can also be printed 1:1 scale for using as manual cutting templates.
I imported the individual STP files into FreeCAD to provide the assembly model in a freely available 3D design platform. (Otherwise, I donâ€™t use FreeCAD and am not familiar with it.)

Design philosophy is for a DIY chess board enclosure with 3mm thick components that can be made with hand tools if desired.
