# ESP-Chess-Board
This project allows a physical chess board powered by an ESP32 microcontroller to connect to WiFi and play other users of ESP-Chessboards.

For board programming see https://github.com/scottyob/esp-chess

The files in this repository are the design and construction of the physical board.

* Design philosophy is a DIY chess board enclosure.
* All components 3mm thick.
* Components can be hand-made if desired. (no geometry beyond the reach of 2D measurements/templates)
* Biuld notes & instructions: ESP_Chess_Biuld_Notes.pdf

Design file formats:

* Two zip files containing the KiCad designs for the PCBs.
* DXF and STP files provided for CNC programming. (laser, etc)
* DXF can be printed 1:1 scale for use as manual cutting templates.
* FreeCAD file provides the assembly model in a freely available 3D design platform.
