# ESP-Chess-Board
DIY chessboard with onboard ESP32 chip to co-ordinate gameplay through a server.

This project is the design and construction of the physical board.

For board programming see https://github.com/scottyob/esp-chess

Design file formats:

* Two zip files containing the KiCad designs for the PCBs.
* DXF and STP files are available for CNC programming. (laser, etc)
* DXF can be printed 1:1 scale for use as manual cutting templates.
* FreeCAD file provides the assembly model in a freely available 3D design platform. (Otherwise, I donâ€™t use FreeCAD and am not familiar with it.)

Design philosophy is a DIY chess board enclosure with all components 3mm thick to facilite construction with hand tools if desired.
